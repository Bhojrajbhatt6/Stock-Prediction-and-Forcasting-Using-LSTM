# Stock-Prediction-and-Forecasting-Using-LSTM-Long-Short-Term-Memory

This repository contains a machine learning model implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Keras to predict stock market prices based on historical data.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to leverage LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks for time series prediction in the context of stock market data. The model is trained on historical stock prices and tested for its ability to generalize to unseen data.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: The programming language used for implementing the model.
- **TensorFlow and Keras**: Deep learning libraries used for building and training the LSTM neural network.
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib**: Data manipulation, numerical operations, and visualization libraries used for data analysis and preprocessing.

## Project Structure

- **`stock_prediction.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
- **`data`**: Folder containing historical stock market data in CSV format.
- **`models`**: Directory to store saved model checkpoints.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, tensorflow

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-market-prediction.git
cd stock-market-prediction
Run the Jupyter notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook stock_prediction.ipynb
Follow the steps in the notebook to load data, preprocess it, build the LSTM model, train, and evaluate.

Process Overview
Data Loading: Historical stock market data is loaded from the CSV file in the data directory.

Data Preprocessing: Data is preprocessed, including scaling using Min-Max scaling, and splitting into training and testing sets.

Model Architecture: A three-layer LSTM model with dropout for regularization is defined using TensorFlow and Keras.
Model Training: The model is trained on the training dataset using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss.

Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated on both the training and test datasets using metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE).

Visualization: Visualizations are provided to compare the model's predictions with actual stock prices.

Future Enhancements
Fine-tune hyperparameters for improved model performance.
Explore the addition of external features or alternative architectures.
Experiment with different time steps and sequence lengths for input data.
